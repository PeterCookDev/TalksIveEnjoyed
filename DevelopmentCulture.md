## Career Skills and IT Culture

- [Jurgen Appelo - The 7 Duties of Great Software Professionals](https://vimeo.com/99516367)  [1:02:27]

- [Kathy Sierra - Making Badass Developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKTxC9pl-WM)  [23:03]

- [James Mickens - It Was Never Going to Work, So Let’s Have Some Tea](https://vimeo.com/146524997)  [31:31]

- [Kjell Ljøstad - How to build and be a part of a highly efficient team](https://vimeo.com/131748093)  [43:35]
Takeaway: Effect of adding someone to the team is not linear, it could even be negative. The Ringlemann effect - as group size increases, need for coordination goes up and individual effort goes down. Relational skills - skills to establish, maintain and develop relationships. Have a positive view of humanity. 3 forms of communication - dialog (lots of questions, win/win), discussion (verbal fight, few questions) and debate (verbal dog fight). 2 forms of listening - correction listening and intention listening. For feedback to have a positive effect, must have a positive relationship with the person.

- [Hadi Hariri - Developers: The Prima Donnas of the 21st Century](https://vimeo.com/52670824)  [57:36]

- [Allison McMillan - BDD: Baby Driven Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZHTg3Hza1U)  [35:39]

- [Ernie Miller - Humane Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZLYxLjwNWo)  [41:45]
Takeaway: Explain why you are doing something and why it is important. And enforced deadline shows that the deadline is more important than building the right product. Don't do crunch mode. Hero programmers are morphine for the organisation, they stop it feeling the pain of its bad processes. Don't communicate out of hours or to people who are on holiday (or while you are on holiday).

- [Dan North - Beyond Developer](https://vimeo.com/139910835)  [26:52]
- [Laura Paterson and Patrick Kua - Technical Leadership](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_nti-mk5IY) [36:25]
- [Simon Brown - Visualise, Document & Explore your Software Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o9_zjZeJuE) [38:17]
Takeaway: C4 approach to visualising architecture.  Documentation often doesn't explain intent or why we do things.  Writing architecture documentation as a guide book - what to look at, maps, culture, history, what is important to understand.

- [\* Lars Klint - The Force Awakens: Mastering Your Inner Developer](https://vimeo.com/181413894) [52:01]
Takeaway: Goals need to push you - write them down. Networking is really important. Learn how to say no. Surround yourself with people who want more. Set goals with your kids.

- [Ross Tuck - Things I Believe Now That I'm Old](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBiexI2mv-k) [43:34]
Takeaway: talk on giving and receiving advice. Consider the source. Consider the context of the advice - is it given from a similar situation? Put it into practice or it means nothing. Everything comes with a price. Meditate on the advice - we often move goalposts without thinking. Collect more advice - code reviews, sprint retros, 360 feedback. Make people feel safe.

- [Martin Thompson - Engineering You!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaFiqCjexOs) [45:59]

- [Kate Matsudaira - Leveling Up - Taking your engineering & operations role to the next level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgxEmiMJVq4)  [38:20]
Takeaway: What would your replacement have that you don't? Use if-then statements to compensate for roadblocks in your goals. You need to let your manager know what you do. Get better at managing your time. Be ready to receiving feedback - Don't be defensive - they don't want an explanation. Nobody cares how much you know, until they know how much you care.

- [Camille Fournier - Cloning Yourself Isn’t an Option](https://vimeo.com/139907569)  [34:41]
Takeaway: As a manager - Availability bias - the more skilled you are in an area, the more you value it. Skills stop being your bottleneck, time becomes your bottleneck or focus does. 3 virtues of a programmer. Laziness - Train people to be your replacement - train more than one. Hubris - find problems but bring the fix. Impatience - anticipate change, focus people on the most important work. Know when to say  "this work is not important and we should not work on it now." What does success look like? Impact (per unit in, what comes out), influence (authority from showing you know what you are doing) and qualitatative feedback. Ask what do I do that you like? What do I do that makes you less effective?

- [Shawn Rider - Work is Not a Dare: Tips for Building Inclusive Teams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdHH5KWGTNo) [37:26]

- [Kim Scott - Superstars vs Rock Stars: Inspire Your Team to Do The Best Work of Their Lives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oChxm4eUbM) [21:46]
Takeaway: Rock stars just rock at what they are doing. Superstars change the world. Not all awesome people want to change the world. Use the rock stars to help people who are good become awesome.  Superstars have a higher growth trajectory but usually leave your organisation quicker. Great model for working with varying growth and performance individuals. Give fair ratings -  reward rock stars as well as super stars.

- [Paulette Luftig - Finding your edge through a culture of feedback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2IgDlCRBVM) [33:28]

- [Jennifer Davis - From Hero to Zero](https://vimeo.com/104252736)  [29:05]
Takeaway: Stop being a hero working long hours. Don't become a single point of failure - failures need to happen. Separate who you are from what you do. 6 areas relating to burnout - Overload of work, lack of control over work, insufficient rewards, workplace community problems, conflict between personal values and job, fairness. Track time doing activities. No single employees working on things.

## Recruitment, Culture, Onboarding and Hiring
- [Austin Fonacier - Hacking Development Culture: Treating Developers As People](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5zll50fRJA) [29:26]
- [Kinsey Ann Durham - Code, Culture and the Pursuit of Happiness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O98rt9Z11LU)  [24:29]
- [Kate Heddleston - Technical Onboarding, Training, and Mentoring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpg4jRSH7EE) [30:12]

- [Pamela Vickers - Your Company Culture is "Awesome"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-gzcfFIv9o) [28:26]
Takeaway: Removing perks will highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the culture. PERMA model - positive emotion, engagement, relationship, meaning, achievement. Shape culture deliberately.

- [Adam Cuppy - Cult(ure)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChVSV9vCs4Y) [32:40]
Takeaway: Cult vs culture mentality within organisations. 90% of people follow certainty (change is something I understand or things today will be the same) and significance (we are important to something or someone). Startups can operate like cults - valuing compliance and instituting hierarchy with the customer at the bottom. Leadership's purpose is to empower other people to work better to serve the customer need. I need to help you win, because then everyone wins. Inclusion begins when you stop using phrases like 'Think like a woman' and start asking 'What does Karen need?'

- [Joe Mastey - Hiring Developers, with Science!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCGGMxcJMZk) [32:31]
Takeaway: Validity - tests a known construct. Reliability - how closely grouped results are. Usability - how easy it is to use. You can only have 2 of them. Test your interviews on your existing team. Have a scoring rubric for the interview to minimise variance and bias. Don't debrief as a group until you have written down feedback. Interviewers will come to the same conclusion so they don't look stupid. Share all feedback at once. 

- [Eric Weinstein - Booting Up: Hiring and Growing Boot Camp Graduates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlnA9IXmDQ0) [40:56]

- [Diane Tate - Creating a Strong Geek Culture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nosGNOADpg)  [19:09]
Takeaway: Hire for shared values. Reward the right behaviours - the how is just as important as the what. Be transparent in processes and choices - make sure it is accessible, make sure people feel they were part of the process. Distribute the responsibility of owning the culture to everyone.

- [Oren Ellenbogen - Building happier engineering teams ](https://vimeo.com/139906437)  [28:22]

- [Sam Barnes - People are Weird, I’m Weird](https://vimeo.com/139910836)[29:34]
Takeaway: Don't lie to candidates. Find out what they don't like and be honest if that is the environment you have.

- [Cate Huston - 12 Challenging Steps to Being a Better Interviewer](https://vimeo.com/139910837)  [21:52]
- [Cate Huston - Applied humaning for technical interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeV62jgu1l0) [32:20]
Takeaway: In a power based situation, the quality of the relationship is owned by the person with the power. Much of what we do as developers is not coding - we should test for those things in the interview. Remove conclusions in feedback you can't support with evidence. Remember interviewing is stressful and people are doing their best. Interviewer needs to be good at time management.

- [Richard Sheridan - Build a Workplace People Love - Just add Joy](https://vimeo.com/144370269)  [01:14:11]
Takeaway: Embrace learning - Books are like potato chips - they should be everywhere! Everyone in building turns up to standup. Get your customer to talk throught the story cards at show and tell, it means you can see if the work is correct, really quickly. Paper based planning scheme - size of paper story = time to do the work. Each sprint only has the stories that fit on that bit of paper.
