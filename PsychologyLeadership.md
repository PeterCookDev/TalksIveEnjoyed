- [Joe Mastey - Hiring Developers, with Science!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCGGMxcJMZk) [32:31]
Takeaway: Validity - tests a known construct. Reliability - how closely grouped results are. Usability - how easy it is to use. You can only have 2 of them. Test your interviews on your existing team. Have a scoring rubric for the interview to minimise variance and bias. Don't debrief as a group until you have written down feedback. Interviewers will come to the same conclusion so they don't look stupid. Share all feedback at once.

- [Sam Barnes - People are Weird, I’m Weird](https://vimeo.com/139910836)[29:34]

- [Cate Huston - 12 Challenging Steps to Being a Better Interviewer](https://vimeo.com/139910837)  [21:52]
- [Cate Huston - Applied humaning for technical interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeV62jgu1l0) [32:20]
Takeaway: In a power based situation, the quality of the relationship is owned by the person with the power. Much of what we do as developers is not coding - we should test for those things in the interview. Remove conclusions in feedback you can't support with evidence. Remember interviewing is stressful and people are doing their best. Interviewer needs to be good at time management.

- [Meredith Noble - Use coaching techniques to help people make their own decisions](https://vimeo.com/128634479)  [22:33]

- [Linda Liukas - A delightful way to teach kids about computers](https://www.ted.com/talks/linda_liukas_a_delightful_way_to_teach_kids_about_computers)  [11:03]

- [Aino Vonge Corry - A Comment on Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI5oxExAj1U) [51:22]
Takeaway: Expert is when you can teach something, when you have an intuitive grasp of the whole situation. Recent memory can only hold 4 elements. Long term memory is used to decode ideas into the recent memory to get past the 4 item limit. Constuctivism - Can only teach using things that people already know and things they already relate to.

- [Marcin Floryan - #NoLearning](https://vimeo.com/98735572)  [25:44]
