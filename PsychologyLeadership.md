- [Denise R Jacobs - Banish your inner critic](https://vimeo.com/channels/ndc2014/97318800)  [52:39]
Takeaway: Eliminate should/must/ought/have to - Banish slave words. Remember things that you have made that are big, and that you are proud of. What screws us up most in life, is the picture in our head of how it is supposed to be. Failure is only the opportunity to begin again more intelligently - Henry Ford. Understand why you procrastinate. Use structured procrastination - have 3 top priorities and work on the second one whilst procrastinating on the first. Have a to-don't list.

Brain uses cognitive biases to make faster decisions. Mere exposure effect - we like things purely because we have been exposed to them. False consensus effect - we believe people agree with us alot more than they do. Groupthink - groups try to avoid conflict by diluting their opinions.

- [Linda Liukas - A delightful way to teach kids about computers](https://www.ted.com/talks/linda_liukas_a_delightful_way_to_teach_kids_about_computers)  [11:03]

- [Aino Vonge Corry - A Comment on Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI5oxExAj1U) [51:22]
Takeaway: Expert is when you can teach something, when you have an intuitive grasp of the whole situation. Recent memory can only hold 4 elements. Long term memory is used to decode ideas into the recent memory to get past the 4 item limit. Constuctivism - Can only teach using things that people already know and things they already relate to.

- [Miki Rezentes - Quit Frustrating Your New Developers - Tips From a Teacher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0cYUD0-XNs) [37:37] 
Takeaway: Purpose of teaching is to reduce the unknowns. Juniors need to see you don't know stuf too. Know what you are teaching - have a core book list and a recommended reading list. The lessons must build on things they already know so make sure you know where they are. Help people understand what good questions are. If they don't understand your answer, repetition won't help.
